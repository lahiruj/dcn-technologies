-- SUMMARY --

Storm (http://drupal.org/project/storm) is a nice and handy project management
suite for Drupal and it comes with organizations, projects, people, invoices,
tasks, notes, and timetracking. This module extends the timetracking functionality
by providing a simple block which displays a list on "in progress" projects. The
user just selects one of those projects when he/she starts working on that project
and as soon as he/she selects a different project, this module creates a records
for timetracking and allows quick access to that record to fill in further details.

In combination with the genius module Storm Dashboard (http://drupal.org/project/storm_dashboard)
the timetracking gets even simpler as it becomes available for all relevant node types
for Storm, i.e. organizations, projects, tasks and tickets.
