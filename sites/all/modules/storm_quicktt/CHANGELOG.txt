- FEATURE: Updated jQuery.timers from version 1.1.3 to 1.2
- FEATURE: Renamed the jQuery.timers file so that it's version independant
- FEATURE: Integrated a small textfield while timetracking is active to allow capturing of notes. These notes get included into the boy field of the timetracking node and can later be edited as usual.
- BUG: Make sure that timer for updating elapsed time gets properly stopped when timetracking gets stopped.
- ISSUE: Trying to avoid duplicate timer-events if the same page is open in more than one browser tab, not resolved yet. This doesn't cause a real issue with the data, but it causes too much traffic between the browser and the server.
- IMPORTANT: Please also update the module storm_dashboard!!!
